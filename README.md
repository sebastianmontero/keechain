# KeeChain

## Description

KeeChain is a Bitcoin application to transform your **offline** computer in an AirGap Signing Device (aka Hardware Wallet).

Note: Currently the GUI is usable but it's not very user-friendly. In the next release (`0.2.0`) the UI/UX will be better.

## Who is this software for?

I'm developing this Bitcoin application thinking to people that live in countries where hardware wallet companies not ship and to people that not want to share own personal data (like home address) with those companies.
Obviously, anyone else can use and test `keechain`!

## Getting started

* [Download from releases](https://github.com/yukibtc/keechain/releases) (remember to run `chmod a+x keechain*`)
* [Build from source](doc/build.md) 
* [Usage](doc/usage.md) 

## Features

* Generate mnemonic (BIP39) using many sources of entropy:
    - True random number generator (TRNG)
    - Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG)
    - Dynamic events: timestamp, boot time, total and free memory, total and free SWAP, OS processes and load average (NOT available on `apple` devices)
    - Static events: hostname, OS and kernel version, global CPU info and device users (NOT available on `apple` devices)
    - Optional: dice roll üé≤
* Restore mnemonic (BIP39)
* Apply and, optionally, save passphrases (BIP39)
* Keychain encryption with AES-256
* Export:
    - Descriptors
    - Bitcoin Core descriptors (same as above but already formatted to be inserted into the console using the `importdescriptors` command)
    - Electrum JSON file (BIP44, BIP49 and BIP84)
    - Wasabi JSON file (BIP84)
* Sign and decode PSBT file
* Deterministic Entropy (BIP85)
* Miniscript support
* Danger:
    - View secrets: entropy, mnemonic, passphrase, HEX seed, BIP32 root key and fingerprint.
    - Wipe: permanently delete keychain
* Optional:
    - [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) sign event delegation (NIP26)
