# KeeChain

## Description

KeeChain is a Bitcoin CLI application to transform your old **offline** computer in a Signing Device (aka Hardware Wallet).

## Features

* Generate BIP39 seed phrase using many sources of entropy:
    - OS source: random bytes provided by OS
    - Dynamic events: timestamp, boot time, free memory, free SWAP, OS processes and load average
    - Static events: hostname, OS and kernel version and global CPU info
    - Optional: add entropy from dice roll üé≤
* Restore BIP39 seed phrase with an optional passphrase
* Seed encryption with AES-256
* Export:
    - Descriptors
    - Bitcoin Core descriptors (same as above but already formatted to be insered into the console using the `importdescriptors` command)
    - Electrum JSON file (BIP44, BIP49 and BIP84)
* PSBT file signer
* Deterministic Entropy (BIP85)
